Welcome to git repo friends!, 

This is my first KMP Project. 

I learn KMP from Udemy's course and applied my knowledge into this simple project.

This project is very useful for KMP beginners like me. It consits all the required base for KMP. 

Feel free to suggest changes by pull request.

Android Kotlin, Multi Platform, MVVM, Ktor, Koin, Dependency Injector
